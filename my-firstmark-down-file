-This is my markdown file and is being created in for the assignment of Git and GitHub fundamentals.
-My name is Shiva Goud Balamoni and i have been trying to learn algorthms.
- Forking and downloading the repository and making it a clone , therefore editing them is a quite good thing as there were no commints 
- can be made until unless there is no authorisation from the owner of the repo.

- i have learned that GitHub will help me in developing the Softwares with a perfect architectural version updates.

- i didnt like the organisation of the github and its features and they have been confusing to learn and make use of , it will be more helpful if they are made with simpler terminology.
